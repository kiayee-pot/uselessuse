            <div class="col-sm-9">
                <p>The School of Useless Use, a.k.a. U + U, is an alternative education institute. We cultivate forms of knowledge whose value is underestimated by mainstream platforms. </p>
                <p>Our work challenges the useless—useful binary that underpins how education pathways in Singapore are designed. We seek to reinstate the place of curiosity and pleasure in learning, and to increase public access to education programmes that are both rigorous and low-stakes. We believe in the exchange of knowledge and skills beyond formal education settings—in what can be shared between u and u. </p>
                <p>We aim to nurture a space for people of all backgrounds to enjoy learning what they want to learn, regardless of whether it is deemed useful by other people, your workplace, or the economy. Useless or useful, it’s up to u.</p>
                <p>We currently focus on editorials and programmes. Read our <a href="opencall.html">Editorial Open Call here</a>.</p>

                <p>A world where learning is a continual process of self-agency and engagement with the known and unknown world. People who cherish and develop forms of knowledge beyond fields which align with quantifiable metrics and productivity. </p>
