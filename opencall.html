            <div class="col-sm-8"><br class="d-none d-md-block">
              <p>We welcome pitches and submissions for essays, interviews, fiction, poetry, and other unconventional textual formats which engage with notions of <strong>refusal and uselessness as strategic and liberatory ways of learning and living</strong>.</p>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>What is worth refusing?</li>
                  <li>What forms of uselessness not only free us from dominant narratives of being productive, useful, usable, but set us on radically and differently meaningful paths?</li>
                  <li>How does the notion of uselessness intersect with ecological and/or communal ways of being in the world?</li>
                  <li>What can we learn from the useless or vestigial?</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>We also invite engagements with refuse in the sense of <strong>trash, garbage, waste</strong>. </p>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>What are unexpected ways of engaging with waste?</li>
                  <li>How does life make waste of us, and how can life be reimagined from the POV of garbage?</li>
                  <li>How can we understand processes of decay, rotting, and fermentation within the context of education and learning?</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Consider the above no more than suggestive prompts that you are welcome to go beyond. More than anything else, we are interested in writing which revitalizes uselessness and garbage as meaningful dimensions of life. Even better if your perspective not only unfolds within the content, but also suffuses the form or format of your piece. </p>
